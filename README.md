- 😁 Hi, I'm a student from Brazil, currently pursuing degree in statistics at Unicamp
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on learning Machine Learning Regressors, Python and Data Science applications.
- 🐆 It would be lovely to collaborate in project to practice my ML and Phyton skills, but you can contact me to work on projects based on React, HTML & CSS, or any project with a positive impact.
